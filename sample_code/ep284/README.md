# [git: check in executable file (+ on windows) (beginner - intermediate)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud6t-mIyhsw&list=PLWBKAf81pmOaP9naRiNAqug6EBnkPakvY&index=286)

Hello and welcome to another video. <br/>
In this one we're gonna be talking about checking in an executable file <br/>
and what you might need to do on windows <br/>
which doesn't have file permissions like linux does.

## Interactive examples

### Windows command line

```powershell
git update-index --chmod=+x t.py
```
