# [typeshed is (often) better than the python docs](https://youtu.be/Vj8ukwPyVMg)

not entirely meant as a dig at the python documentation but more of an introduction to a resource that I use all the time and think is really really good!

## Interactive examples

### Bash

```bash
virtualenv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install mypy

ls venv/lib/python*/site-packages/mypy/typeshed/
```
