1. options

    - "the right to purchase a stock" (usually at a discount)
    - a grant: # of things after a condition
        - vest over time
        - "1 year cliff" w/ "4 year vest"
        - "strike price" - price that you can purchase at

    - typically: given at companies which are private
    - "exercise": purchase it!
    - (typically) 2 conditions where options are live
        - company goes public: stock is publicly tradeable
        - company is purchased / bought out / etc.
        - "liquidity events"

    - best case scenario:
        - very early at a company (so your strike price is low ($.Q2)
        - you stay at the company for a long time (years+)
        - the company goes public while you are still there
        - the stock price is big $$$ ($10 / share)
        - you exercise everything and ride off into the sunset

    - HOW OPTIONS EXPIRE: you leave the company.
        - ~typically given 90 days after leaving the company to either
          exercise (buy the options) or let them expire

2. RSUs: value granted

    - RSU: "restricted stock unit"
    - granted (similar to options) - but you just get the share
    - "double trigger": (1) you vest (2) a liquidity event
    - expiration: do not go away when you leave the company
        - 7 year period
    - you get a grant
        - instead of a share count: you are given a dollar amount
        - @ the vest point you get ($ amount / share price) shares
    - 4 year grant, each year $120,000 RSUs
        - at end of year 1, company is valued at $60 / share
            - 2,000 RSUs
        - at end of year 2, company is valued at $30 / share
            - 4,000 RSUs

    - 4000 shares per year over 4 years (1 years cliffs)
        - at end of year 1, company is valued at $100 / share
            - +4000 shares (400k)
        - at end of year 2, company is valued at $1 / share
            - +4000 shares (8k)

3. classic RSUs grants
    - incentivize you to improve the company
    - ~essentially cash
    - don't lose them when you leave the company

4. ESPP (employee stock purchase plans)

    - typically at public companies
    - similar to options they allow you to purchase at a lower price
    - sell them immediately (or after a holding period)
