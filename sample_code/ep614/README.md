# [my (bad) distributed system for sentry mypy stats (and cool graphs from viewers!)](https://youtu.be/ZwGDqjx-W2k)

today I show off the design of the scripts I used to collect data for mypy error reduction in sentry over time!  I also show off some cool graphs made by viewers :)

## Interactive examples

### Bash

```bash
git clone git@github.com:asottile/sentry-mypy-stats
cd sentry-mypy-stats/
```
